  # unit tests for get_trip
  # Calculates a trip from a specified origin to a specified destination.
  # Calculates a trip from a specified origin to a specified destination. These might be stop/station IDs or coordinates based on addresses and points of interest validated by the location service or coordinates freely defined by the client. Parameters specifying both origin and destination are mandatory in calls to the trip service. When specifying a stop as origin, the parameter originId is used, while originCoordLat, originCoordLong, and originCoordName are used to specify a (named) coordinate. For the destination, the corresponding parameters are named either destId or destCoordLat, destCoordLong and destCoordName. It is also possible to define a via-stop/station. This forces the journey planner to search for trips which pass the defined station. The parameter is called viaId. When searching for a trip that goes via a coordinate, rather than a stop, two separate trip requests need to be combined into one.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Integer] :origin_id origin stop id
  # @option opts [Float] :origin_coord_lat origin latitude of center coordinate in the WGS84 system
  # @option opts [Float] :origin_coord_long origin longitude of center coordinate in the WGS84 system
  # @option opts [String] :origin_coord_name name of the address at the specified origin coordinate
  # @option opts [Integer] :dest_id destination stop id

  # @option opts [String] :search_for_arrival to specify that the given time and date is not the departure time but the latest time to arrive at the destination, set this parameter to the value 1.
  # @option opts [String] :use_vas to exclude trips with Västtågen, set this parameter to 0.
  # @option opts [String] :use_ld_train to exclude trips with long distance trains, set this parameter to 0.
  # @option opts [String] :use_reg_train to exclude trips with regional trains, set this parameter to 0.
  # @option opts [String] :use_bus to exclude trips with buses, set this parameter to 0.
  # @option opts [String] :use_medical to include medical transport lines trips with buses, set this parameter to 1.
  # @option opts [String] :origin_medical_con to search for medical transport connections from the origin, set this parameter to 1.
  # @option opts [String] :dest_medical_con to search for medical transport connections from the destination, set this parameter to 1.
  # @option opts [String] :wheel_chair_space to search for trips where at least one wheelchair space is present in the vehicle, set this parameter to 1.
  # @option opts [String] :stroller_space to search for trips with space for stroller, baby carriage or rollator in the vehicle, set this parameter to 1.
  # @option opts [String] :low_floor to search for trips where the vehicle is equipped with a low floor section, but not necessarily a ramp or lift, set this parameter to 1.
